## Description

Player 1 enters a word or phrase and submits it. The vowel remover application replaces all of the vowels in the word or phrase with hyphens and displays it on a new page. Then, player 2 can try to guess the word or phrase. When the second player has guessed it or gives up, they can click a button to reveal the original input.
